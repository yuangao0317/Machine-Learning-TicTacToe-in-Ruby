# Machine Learning TicTacToe in Ruby
This is a Ruby CLI TicTacToe game implemented with Machine Learning(reinforcement learning)

[](screenshot/screenshot1)

## Description
This is my first side project in Flatiron School after I learn Ruby for 8 days. Thus, the code may be ugly, and I haven't had time to refactor it. At that time, I hadn't learned GitHub, so there are no commits, but the project contents my original works in comments.

## How to play

In terminal:

git clone https://github.com/YuanGao0317/Machine-Learning-TicTacToe-in-Ruby.git

cd Machine-Learning-TicTacToe-in-Ruby

ruby bin/tictactoe_q

Please choose a game mode:

1. Play with AI

2. Smart Training

3. Normal Training


There are three mode. 
The first one allows you to play with the Machine Learning AI. If you delete the database(training_data.json), you can see how the AI learns to solve your strategy.
The second one is a training process with two AIs.
The third one is a training process with one AI and another normal AI.
